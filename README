Currently implemented :
Check translation numbers -> words
Check translation words -> numbers

Upgrades to do
Launcher : make it not that crappy
NumbersInWords :
- Parser rules : Make a system of pattern validation/exclusion so the code can be more generic
- Localization upgrade : add localization in resources and modulate parsers so it can be localization dependant
- Lexer : Make localized data-oriented word to tokens translation instead static dictionary in the code
- Interpreter : Make it generic and localized too
